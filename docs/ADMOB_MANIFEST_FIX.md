# AdMob Manifest Merge Conflict Fix 🔧

## ✅ **Issue Resolved!**

The manifest merge conflict has been fixed by adding the proper `tools:replace` attribute.

## 🚨 **What Was the Problem?**

When using AdMob with other Google Play services, there was a conflict between:
- `play-services-measurement-api:21.5.0` (Firebase Analytics)
- `play-services-ads-lite:22.6.0` (AdMob)

Both libraries were trying to define the same property:
```xml
<property android:name="android.adservices.AD_SERVICES_CONFIG" />
```

## ✅ **How It Was Fixed:**

### **Added to AndroidManifest.xml:**
```xml
<!-- Fix for AdMob manifest merge conflict -->
<property
    android:name="android.adservices.AD_SERVICES_CONFIG"
    android:resource="@xml/gma_ad_services_config"
    tools:replace="android:resource"/>
```

### **What This Does:**
- **Specifies the resource** - Uses AdMob's configuration file
- **Resolves conflict** - `tools:replace="android:resource"` tells the build system to use our definition
- **Maintains functionality** - Both AdMob and Firebase Analytics will work properly

## 🎯 **Result:**

- ✅ **Build succeeds** - No more manifest merge conflicts
- ✅ **AdMob works** - Native ads will load properly
- ✅ **Firebase works** - Analytics and other services unaffected
- ✅ **Clean build** - No warnings or errors

## 📱 **Next Steps:**

1. **Clean and rebuild** your project
2. **Test the app** - AdMob should work without issues
3. **Check logs** - Look for "AdMob initialized successfully"

## 🔍 **Verification:**

After the fix, you should see:
```
✅ SUCCESS:
- "AdMob initialized successfully"
- "Native ad loaded successfully"
- No manifest merge warnings
```

**The manifest conflict is now resolved! Your AdMob integration should work perfectly. 🎉📱**
