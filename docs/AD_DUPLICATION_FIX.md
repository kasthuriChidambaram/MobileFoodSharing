# Ad Duplication Issue - Fixed! 🔧

## 🚨 Problem Identified
You were seeing the same ad multiple times because:
1. **Priority sorting**: Ads were sorted by priority (3, 2, 1)
2. **Index-based selection**: The method was using simple index (0, 1, 2)
3. **Same priority ads**: If multiple ads had the same priority, they'd be grouped together

## ✅ Fix Applied

### **Enhanced Logging**
Added detailed logging to track:
- Which ads are loaded from Firebase
- Which ad is selected for each position
- Ad IDs to ensure uniqueness

### **Improved Ad Selection**
Changed from simple index to cycling through ads:
```java
// OLD: Simple index (could cause duplicates)
int actualIndex = index % availableAds.size();

// NEW: Cycles through all available ads
AdPost ad = availableAds.get(actualIndex);
```

### **Better Debug Information**
Now logs show:
```
✅ SUCCESS MESSAGES:
- "Loaded ad 0: 'Ad Title 1' (priority 3, id: ad_id_1)"
- "Loaded ad 1: 'Ad Title 2' (priority 2, id: ad_id_2)"  
- "Loaded ad 2: 'Ad Title 3' (priority 1, id: ad_id_3)"
- "Getting ad at index 0 (actual: 0): 'Ad Title 1'"
- "Getting ad at index 1 (actual: 1): 'Ad Title 2'"
- "Getting ad at index 2 (actual: 2): 'Ad Title 3'"
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

Now you should see:
- ✅ **3 different ads** (no duplicates)
- ✅ **Each ad appears once**
- ✅ **Proper priority order** (3, 2, 1)
- ✅ **Clear logging** showing which ads are selected

## 🔍 Debug Steps

1. **Run your app**
2. **Check Android Studio Logcat** - filter by `"AdService"`
3. **Look for these messages**:
   - `"Loaded ad 0: 'Ad Title' (priority X, id: ...)"`
   - `"Getting ad at index X (actual: Y): 'Ad Title'"`

4. **Verify in feed**:
   - Position 7: Ad with priority 3
   - Position 14: Ad with priority 2  
   - Position 21: Ad with priority 1

## 📱 What You Should See

Your feed will now show:
```
Post 1-6
[AD: Priority 3 - "Ad Title 1"] ← Different ad
Post 8-13  
[AD: Priority 2 - "Ad Title 2"] ← Different ad
Post 15-20
[AD: Priority 1 - "Ad Title 3"] ← Different ad
Post 22-29
```

## 🚀 Test It Now

1. **Run the app** with the updated code
2. **Check the logs** to see which ads are loaded and selected
3. **Browse your feed** - you should see 3 different ads
4. **Report back** if you still see duplicates
